Right now as I am writing this I find myself in a state of restlessness, torn between the need for sleep, the urge to check my socials and the motivation to do something productive for once. 

Boredom - a distant memory perhaps, for our lives satiated by the relentless dopamine drips of instant gratification. Indeed much of the boredom in my life has been displaced by a constant, latent sense of ennui - what Singaporeans will describe with the singular, all-compassing adjective of 'sian'. For all my existence I have been searching for ways to occupy myself. The idle mind is a dangerous thing. It thinks itself into circles, contradicting itself at every turn and by the magic of ex falso quodlibet conjures the most outlandish of fictions and passes them off as fact. And let's not ignore the underlying sentimentality - the restless sea. my thoughts, drifting on makeshift rafts occasionally spiral into its murky depths, devolving, dissolving into currents of primiveal emotional soup. 

Drownsiness has prevailed for the night - I shall retire to bed.
