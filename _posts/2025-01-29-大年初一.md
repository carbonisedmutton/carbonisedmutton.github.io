过年了！

And so it is in a foreign land, where it scarcely matters. 

Well, if it matters to anyone, here's what I was up to in the past 15 days since coming. 

14/01 - Flight

15/01 - Moving in, walked around the meadow with Nic. 

16/01 - Collections 1

17/01 - Collections 2

18/01 - Started on 酒酿

19/01 - 

20/01 - 

21/01 - 

22/01 - 

23/01 - 

24/01 - Trip to Birmingham with Ruixuan, Chuyang, Emmy, Nebula. Pool afterwards - something brewing between RX and N. 

25/01 - 三国杀 in the evening. Rainy day otherwise. Made a regrettable decision to eat out for brunch - tasted the same but for triple the price. Never again! 

26/01 - 

27/01 - 

28/01 - Work in the afternoon, then 1525 dinner and 年夜饭 in Staverton. Brought the 酒酿 there - well received. Had an interesting lesson in dragon dance by Yi Lin. 

29/01 - Skipped my first lecture, went for a interesting seminar with a Japanese professor who about explaining the question-order effect and replicable repeated responses by modelling human preferences by mixed quantum state and questioning by a general quantum instrument. Never really thought about this before - worth a review. Spent the night in Magdalen in Elaina's room having a imprompto karaoke - was meant to be a session of Figgy but turned out otherwise. 

30/01 - Lunch with Judy. Had an interesting conversation about politics but we were sadly interrupted. Went on a long run in the afternoon to Wytham woods - achieved a respectable time. 

31/01 - 

01/02 - Whole day devoted to OAF - quant research lecture series went well despite the broken facilities in Brasenose. Pizza for dinner, depressing since I missed informal. Into the Woods was a rather peculiar musical I watched in the evening. 三国杀 again, met David Li from Univ. 

02/02 - Beautiful day trip to the Brill windmill with Alex. Sunny, cloudless skies. Had a great potluck dinner in Iffley with Enyu. RX must have had an excellent evening with Orion. 

03/02 - Spent the whole day out - Lunch at St Johns and Taylorian for studying in the afternoon and tutorial before dinner. Scholars' Formal was rather enjoyable - great conversation and 2 seats away from the Dean paired with generous servings of wine. 

04/02 - Chill day, ended with formal at St Hugh's. Tried the scooter thing for the first time. Should have taken my bike anyways, had the wheel not been bent earlier in the morning. Lunch at SBS. Tried to fix my bike in the afternoon but ended up breaking 2 spokes on the wheel. 

05/02 - Must have been one of the busiest days this term. Had 8(!) events on my schedule - 5 hours of lectures, 2 tutorials and 2 events in the evening. I must say the lecture on agentic AI was rather deja vu. Calligraphy at SBS was fun and maths games night turned out quite well indeed.
