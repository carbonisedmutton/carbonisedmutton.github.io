今早我又跑去了Peirce.

贝尔斯蓄水池位于新加坡本岛的中部。蓄水池有两个，分别为贝尔斯上段与贝尔斯下段，中间隔着一座大坝。
蓄水池由森林环绕，绿意葱葱，围绕着水边还有几段木板走道，是个运动，休闲的好去处。

My running route brings me up Old Thomson Road, skirting the edge of the nature reserve 
before turning abruptly into the greenery as I leave the last row of shophouses behind. 
There the road (hitherto a race track) twists and turns, bringing me ever deeper into the 
jungle. A hairpin bend in the midpoint conceals the gate to Upper Peirce resevoir, 
upon entering which one is greeted by a brutal series of knolls - and at last! - a light
breeze heralds my arrival by the water's edge. Taking a right turn just before the destination 
I make a detour to the water treatment plant before rejoining the main road, which ends 
shortly at the dam separating the upper and lower reservoirs. 

蓄水池上段与下段之分别名副其实，上段蓄水池比下段高出20米有余。马路通道大坝的上方，右边脚下即在水边，
左边则是陡坡至于下方的水池，新加坡对等的Hoover Dam或三峡大坝，即使如此吧。
