I must confess (and I do so sheepishly) that this is not the first journal/diary/sundry record of my (admittedly boring) life that I've started since my literary enlightenment a few years ago. And sadly for my non-existent readers it shall not be the last for some time to come, at least not until I've escaped my diletantte self and learnt to commit to a single endeavour, however frivolous it may be. 

And frivolous it is, my friends in the void, for my thoughts (and I presume those of most humans) issue forth from the primordial streams of subconsciousness generation; and unike a large language model the size of my context window is far too small for synthesising these strands into a coherent whole. Not that I'm actively making an effort to - if I had to write like an essayist I would abandoned this project in two lines. 

So consider this is my valiant attempt to pen down and organise my thoughts - minimally censored, lightly curated - as they come by, and perhaps allow my deepest emotional vulnerabilities to escape their odyssey in the photosphere and escape to an endless journey across the universe. 

Let there be light.
